Always use file scoped namespaces. Always combine attributes on a single line when possible. 
The project does not use nullable reference types. 
There is a GlobalUsings.cs file that includes common usings, don't include using statements in new files if they are already in the globalusings.cs file.
I prefer expression bodied members when possible. Single line if statements should still use braces. Use ternary operators when appropriate. 
Use internal over private. All classes and methods are public unless told otherwise. Don't add a constructor unless instructed to do so. 
Use primary constructors when possible and don't declare a class level variable if the parameter from the constructor can be used.
Don't initialize properties unless instructed to do so.

In the Autolot.Dal project, create a new folder named EfStructures. In that folder, create a class named 
ApplicationDbContext, inherit from DbContext, use a primary constructor to accept a strongly typed instance of 
DbContextOptions and pass the options to the base class. Add a DbSet property for every entity in the AutoLot.Models.Entities folder.

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file if they do not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using AutoLot.Dal.EfStructures;

Add the override for OnModelCreating in the ApplicationDbContext class and use it to call all of the entity and 
view model configuration class Configure methods, passign in the appropriate modelBuilder.Entity<T>.

In the EfStructures folder, create a new class named ApplicationDbContextFactory that implements IDesignTimeDbContextFactory<ApplicationDbContext>.
Add the CreateDbContext method to return a new instance of ApplicationDbContext. Use SqlServer as the database provider.
