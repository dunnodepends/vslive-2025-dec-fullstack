Always use file scoped namespaces. Always combine attributes on a single line when possible. 
The project does not use nullable reference types. 
There is a GlobalUsings.cs file that includes common usings, don't include using statements in new files if they are already in the globalusings.cs file.
I prefer expression bodied members when possible. Single line if statements should still use braces. Use ternary operators when appropriate. 
Use internal over private. All classes and methods are public unless told otherwise. Don't add a constructor unless instructed to do so. 
Use primary constructors when possible and don't declare a class level variable if the parameter from the constructor can be used.
Don't initialize properties unless instructed to do so.
Use MaxLength instead of StringLength for maximum length attributes. 

In the autolot.models project, create a new folder named Entities. In that folder, create another folder name Base.
Inside the base folder, create an abstract class named BaseEntity with the following public properties:
Id (int, Attributes: Key, Database Generated Identity )
TimeStamp (long,Timestamp attribute).

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file if they do not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements). 
global using AutoLot.Models.Entities;
global using AutoLot.Models.Entities.Base;

In the Autolot.Models project Entities folder, create a new folder named ComplexTypes. In that folder, create a class named Person. 
Add the ComplexType attribute to the class and add the following public properties:
FirstName (string, attributes: required, max length 50)
LastName (string, attributes: required, max length 50)
FullName (string, attributes: Database Generated and Computed)

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file if they do not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using AutoLot.Models.Entities.ComplexTypes;

In the Autolot.Models project Entities folder, create a class named Car and inherit from the BaseEntity. 
Call the table name “Inventory” in the “dbo” schema. 
Add an index to the class on MakeId named "IX_Inventory_MakeId"
Add the following public properties:
Color (string, attributes: required, max length 50)
Price (string)
IsDrivable (bool, initialized to true, attributes: DisplayName = "Is Drivable")
DateBuilt (DateTime?)
Display (string, attributes: Database Generated and Computed)
PetName (string, attributes: required, max length 50, DisplayName = “Pet Name”)
MakeId (int, attributes: required, DisplayName = “Make”)

In the Autolot.Models project Entities folder, create a class named CarDriver and inherit from the BaseEntity. Call the table name “InventoryToDrivers” in the “dbo” schema. Add the following public properties:
DriverId (int)
CarId (int, attributes: Column = “InventoryId”)
Add a unique index to CarDriver.cs on the combination of DriverId and CarId named "IX_InventoryToDrivers_DriverId_CarId"

In the Autolot.Models project Entities folder, create a class named Driver and inherit from the BaseEntity. Call the table name “Drivers” in the “dbo” schema. Add the following public properties:
PersonInformation (person, initialized to new Person)

In the Autolot.Models project Entities folder, create a class named Make and inherit from the BaseEntity. Call the table name “Makes” in the “dbo” schema. Add the following public properties:
Name (string, attributes: required, max length 50)

In the Autolot.Models project Entities folder, create a class named Radio and inherit from the BaseEntity. Call the table name “Radios” in the “dbo” schema. Add the following public properties:
HasTweeters (bool)
HasSubWoofers (bool)
RadioId (string, attributes: required, max length 50)
CarId (int, attributes: column name “InventoryId”)

In the Autolot.Models project Entities folder, create a class named SeriLogEntry. Call the table name “SeriLogs” in the “Logging” schema. Add the following public properties:
Id (int, attributes: Key, Database Generated Identity)
Message, MessageTemplate (string)
Level (string, attributes: max length 128)
TimeStamp (DateTime)
Exception, Properties, LogEvent, SourceContext, RequestPath, ActionName, ApplicationName, MachineName, FilePath, MemberName (string)
LineNumber (nullable int)
PropertiesXml (XElement, readonly property with value of: Properties != null ? XElement.Parse(Properties) : null, attributes: not mapped)

In the Autolot.Models project, create a new folder named ViewModels. 
In that folder, create a class named CarViewModel with the Keyless attribute and following public properties:
Id (int)
IsDrivable (bool)
DateBuilt (DateTime?)
Price (string)
MakeId (int)
Color (string, initialized to string.Empty)
PetName (string, initialized to string.Empty)

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file if they do not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using AutoLot.Models.ViewModels;
