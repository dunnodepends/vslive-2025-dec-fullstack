Always use file scoped namespaces. Always combine attributes on a single line when possible. 
The project does not use nullable reference types. 
There is a GlobalUsings.cs file that includes common usings, don't include using statements in new files if they are already in the globalusings.cs file.
I prefer expression bodied members when possible. Single line if statements should still use braces. Use ternary operators when appropriate. 
Use internal over private. All classes and methods are public unless told otherwise. Don't add a constructor unless instructed to do so. 
Use primary constructors when possible and don't declare a class level variable if the parameter from the constructor can be used.
Don't initialize properties unless instructed to do so.


In the Autolot.Models project, create a new folder named Exceptions. In that folder, create a folder named Base. 
In that folder, create a class named CustomException, inherit from Exception, and implement all of the public constructors.

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file in the AutoLot.Dal and the AutoLot.Models projects if they do not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using AutoLot.Models.Exceptions;
global using AutoLot.Models.Exceptions.Base;

In the Autolot.Dal project, create a new folder named Exceptions. In that folder, create three new files, 
CustomConcurrencyException, CustomDbUpdateException, and CustomRetryLimitExceededException. All of them need to inherit from CustomException.
Implement the default constructors.
The constructor that takes an inner exception should use DbUpdateConcurrencyException, DbUpdateException, and RetryLimitExceededException respectively as the inner exception type.

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file in AutoLot.Dal project if they do not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using AutoLot.Dal.Exceptions;
