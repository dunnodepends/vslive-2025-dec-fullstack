Always use file scoped namespaces. Always combine attributes on a single line when possible. 
The project does not use nullable reference types. 
There is a GlobalUsings.cs file that includes common usings, don't include using statements in new files if they are already in the globalusings.cs file.
I prefer expression bodied members when possible. Single line if statements should still use braces. Use ternary operators when appropriate. 
Use internal over private. All classes and methods are public unless told otherwise. Don't add a constructor unless instructed to do so. 
Use primary constructors when possible and don't declare a class level variable if the parameter from the constructor can be used.
Don't initialize properties unless instructed to do so.

In the AutoLot.Models project, update the Configuration files for Car, CarDriver, Driver, Make, and Radio to include temporal table configuration.
Use ValidTo and ValidFrom as the period columns. Name the history tables dbo.[EntityName]Audit, for example, dbo.DriversAudit. 
Except for Car, name it InventoryAudit, and CarDriver, name it InventoryToDriversAudit.

In the AutoLot.Models project, add a new class to the ViewModels folder named TemporalViewModel.cs that is generic, 
constrained to BaseEntity, new(), and contains the following public properties:
Entity (T)
ValidFrom (datetime)
ValidTo (datetime)

In the AutoLot.Dal project, add a new interface named ITemporalTableBaseRepo.cs into the Repos\Interfaces\Base directory. Have it inherit from IBaseRepo<T> with the same constraints Add the following methods:
  IQueryable<TemporalViewModel<T>> GetAllHistory();
  IQueryable<TemporalViewModel<T>> GetHistoryAsOf(DateTime dateTime);
  IQueryable<TemporalViewModel<T>> GetHistoryBetween(DateTime startDateTime, DateTime endDateTime);
  IQueryable<TemporalViewModel<T>> GetHistoryContainedIn(DateTime startDateTime, DateTime endDateTime);
  IQueryable<TemporalViewModel<T>> GetHistoryFromTo(DateTime startDateTime, DateTime endDateTime);


In the AutoLot.Dal project, add a new class named TemporalTableBaseRepo.cs into the Repos\Base directory. Have it inherit from BaseRepo<T> with the same constraints, and implement ITemporalTableBaseRepo. Implement all of the interfaces methods using the ConvertToUtc helper. Add an internal helper method named
ConvertToUtc that takes a date time and uses TimeXZoneInfo to convert the time passed in. Add another internal method named ExecuteQuery that takes an IQueryable<T>, ordered by "ValidFrom", and project that into a new instance if TemporalViewModel.

In the AutoLot.Dal project, update the following Interfaces to inherit from ITemporalTableBaseRepo instead of IBaseRepo:
  ICarRepo,  ICarDriverRepo, IDriverRepo, IMakeRepo, IRadioRepo

In the AutoLot.Dal project, update the following Repos to inherit from TemporalTableBaseRepo instead of BaseRepo:
  CarRepo, CarDriverRepo, DriverRepo, MakeRepo, RadioRepo
