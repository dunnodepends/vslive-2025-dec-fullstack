Always use file scoped namespaces. Always combine attributes on a single line when possible. 
The project does not use nullable reference types. 
There is a GlobalUsings.cs file that includes common usings, don't include using statements in new files if they are already in the globalusings.cs file.
I prefer expression bodied members when possible. Single line if statements should still use braces. Use ternary operators when appropriate. 
Use internal over private. All classes and methods are public unless told otherwise. Don't add a constructor unless instructed to do so. 
Use primary constructors when possible and don't declare a class level variable if the parameter from the constructor can be used.
Don't initialize properties unless instructed to do so.

When creating collection navigation properties, always initialize them to new instances of the collection as an List<T>. 
Also, always use ICollection<T> for collection navigation properties.
Name navigation properties using plural names for collections and singular names with navigation as the suffix for single instances.
Always use the nameof() function instead of string literals when specifying foreign key names and inversepropeties in attributes.
Always add the ForeignKey atribute for intances navigation properties unless otherwise specified.
Always add the InverseProperty attribute for all navigation properties.
All navigation properties should have get and set, even when initialized.

In the Auolot.Models project, update Car.cs:
Add MakeNavigation, ForeignKey of MakeId, InverseProperty of Make.Cars
Add RadioNavigation, No ForeignKey, InverseProperty of Radio.CarNavigation
Add ICollection<Driver> Drivers, InverseProperty of Driver.Cars
Add ICollection<CarDriver> CarDrivers, InverseProperty of CarDriver.CarNavigation
Update CarDriver.cs:
Add DriverNavigation, ForeignKey of DriverId, InverseProperty of Driver.CarDrivers
Add CarNavigation, ForeignKey of CarId, InverseProperty of Car.CarDrivers
Update Driver.cs:
Add ICollection<Car> Cars, InverseProperty of Car.Drivers
Add ICollection<CarDriver> CarDrivers, InverseProperty of CarDriver.DriverNavigation
Update Make.cs:
Add ICollection<Car> Cars, InverseProperty of Car.MakeNavigation
Update Radio.cs:
Add CarNavigation, ForeignKey of CarId, InverseProperty of Car.RadioNavigation

In the Autolot.Models project, update Car.cs with the following property:
Add public string MakeName (string, not mapped, readonly property with value of: MakeNavigation?.Name ?? "Unknown")
Add override for ToString() method to return $"{PetName ?? "**No Name**"} is a {Color} {MakeNavigation?.Name} with ID {Id}.".
