Always use file scoped namespaces. Always combine attributes on a single line when possible. 
The project does not use nullable reference types. 
There is a GlobalUsings.cs file that includes common usings, don't include using statements in new files if they are already in the globalusings.cs file.
I prefer expression bodied members when possible. Single line if statements should still use braces. Use ternary operators when appropriate. 
Use internal over private. All classes and methods are public unless told otherwise. 
Don't add a constructor unless instructed to do so. 
Use primary constructors when possible and don't declare a class level variable if the parameter from the constructor can be used.
Don't initialize properties unless instructed to do so.


All work is to be done in the AutoLot.Services project unless otherwise specified.

In the Logging folder, add a public sealed class named AppLogging.cs. Make the class implement IAppLogging. Add a default constructor that takes an instance of ILogger<AppLogging>. Add two internal helper methods: LogWithException and LogWithoutException. 
Both methods should take strings for memberName, filePath, and int for lineNumber, and a string message. The LogWithException method also needs to take and exception (ex) and an Action<Exception,string, object[]> named logAction. The LogWithoutException should take an Action<string, object[]> logAction. Both members need to push the memberName, filePath, lineNumber onto the LogContext, adding the return values from the calls to a List<IDisposable>, then execute the logAction with the message and an empty object array. Then the methods need to dispose of the items in the List<IDisposable> returned from the LogContext.PushProperty method. Then implement all of the interface methods and use the attributes from the interface in the interface methods.

Add a new folder named utilities, and in that folder add a public static class named StringExtensions. Add a C# 14 extension block that takes in a string (this block should not have any modifiers nor be static). Add a method in the block named RemoveControllerSuffix that replaces the word "Controller" at the end of a string with an empty string and returns the result. If the string does not end with "Controller", return the original string. Use OrdinalIgnoreCase for the comparison.

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file if they do not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using AutoLot.Services.Utilities;


Add a new folder named Simple, and in that folder add a new folder named Interfaces. In the Interfaces folder, add an interface named ISimpleService that has a method named SayHello that returns a string. In the Simple folder, add two classes named SimpleServiceOne and SimpleServiceTwo, both implement the ISimpleService interface, and return Hello from One and Hello from Two, respectively.

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file if they do not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using AutoLot.Services.Simple;
global using AutoLot.Services.Simple.Interfaces;
