Always use file scoped namespaces. Always combine attributes on a single line when possible. 
The project does not use nullable reference types. 
There is a GlobalUsings.cs file that includes common usings, don't include using statements in new files if they are already in the globalusings.cs file.
I prefer expression bodied members when possible. Single line if statements should still use braces. Use ternary operators when appropriate. 
Use internal over private. All classes and methods are public unless told otherwise. Use primary constructors when possible and don't declare a class level variable if the parameter from the constructor can be used. Add ValidateAntiForgeryToken attribute on all HttpPost methods

All work is to be done in the AutoLot.Mvc project unless otherwise specified.

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file if they do not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using AutoLot.Dal.Repos.Base;
global using AutoLot.Dal.Repos.Interfaces.Base;
global using AutoLot.Models.Entities.Base;
global using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering;


In the Controllers folder, add a new folder named Base and add a new public abstract class named BaseCrudController. Make it generic with TEntity, constrained to BaseEntity, new(). Add the Route (controller/action) to the top of the class. Accept two parameters in the constructor, IAppLogging (appLogging) and IBaseRepo<TEntity> (baseRepo). Assign the parameters to two protected readonly properties named AppLoggingInstance and BaseRepoInstance, respectively. Add the following protected methods:
abstract GetLookupValues (input:none. return type: SelectList)
GetOneEntity (input:int? id. return type: TEntity. Logic:return null if id is null, else call Find on BaseRepoInstance)
Add the following public virtial action methods:
HttpGet Index - add Route(/Controller) and Route(/Controller/Action) attributes. (input:none. return type: IActionResult. Logic: return View with call to GetAllIgnoreQueryFilters as the model)
HttpGet("{id?}") Details -  (input int?. return IActionResult. Logic: if id does not have a value, return BadRequest. Else call GetOneEntity. If Entity is null, return NotFound(). else return View(entity)
HttpGet Create Assign ViewData["LookupValues] = GetLookupValues(), return View
HttpPost Create (input TEntity entity. return IActionResult. Logic: if ModelState is not valid, assign ViewData["LookupValues"] = GetLookupValues(), return View(entity). Else call Add on BaseRepoInstance with entity, then redirect to Details)
HttpGet("{id?}) Edit (input int? id. return IActionResult. Logic: If id.hasvalue isn't true, return BadRequest(). If GetOneEntity returns null, return NotFound(). Assign ViewData["LookupValues] = GetLookupValues(), return View(entity)
HttpPost("{id}") Post (input int id, TEntity entity. return IActionResult. Logic: if id != entity.Id, return BadRequest, if ModelState is not valid, assign ViewData["LookupValues"] = GetLookupValues(), return View(entity). Else call Update on BaseRepoInstance with entity, then redirect to Details)
HttpGet("{id?}) Delete (input int? id. return IActionResult. Logic: If id.hasvalue isn't true, return BadRequest(). If GetOneEntity returns null, return NotFound(). return View(entity)
HttpPost("{id}") Post (input int id, TEntity entity. return IActionResult. Logic: if id != entity.Id, return BadRequest, Call Delete on BaseRepoInstance with entity, then redirect to Index)

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file if they do not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using AutoLot.Mvc.Controllers.Base;

Remove the route from the CarsController and have it inherit from BaseCrudController with TEntity as Car. Use a primary contructor to accept IAppLogging and ICarRepo parameters and pass them to the base constructor. Also take in a IMakeRepo (makeRepo) parameter (do not assign it to a class field. Override the GetLookupValues method to return a SelectList of all Makes from the makeRepo ordered by Name, with Id as the value field and Name as the text field. Add another action method:
HttpGet("{makeId}/{mAKEnAME}") ByMake (input int makeId, string makeName. return IActionResult. Logic: return View with a model of the result of casting BaseRepoInstance to ICarRepo and calling GetAllBy passing in the makeId. Set the ViewBag.MakeName = makeName.
(no HTTP verb) BadEndPoint (input:none. return IActionResult. Logic: return new OkObjectResult(5)) Comment out this method after adding it.
