Always use file scoped namespaces. Always combine attributes on a single line when possible. 
The project does not use nullable reference types. 
There is a GlobalUsings.cs file that includes common usings, don't include using statements in new files if they are already in the globalusings.cs file.
I prefer expression bodied members when possible. Single line if statements should still use braces. Use ternary operators when appropriate. 
Use internal over private. All classes and methods are public unless told otherwise. Don't add a constructor unless instructed to do so. 
Use primary constructors when possible and don't declare a class level variable if the parameter from the constructor can be used.
Don't initialize properties unless instructed to do so. 

All work is to be done in the AutoLot.Mvc project unless otherwise specified.

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file if they do not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using AutoLot.Services.DataServices.Dal;
global using AutoLot.Services.DataServices.Interfaces;
global using AutoLot.Services.DataServices.Interfaces.Base;

Add the following to the Program.cs file, after the existing service registrations:
builder.Services.AddScoped<ICarDataService, CarDalDataService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMakeDataService, MakeDalDataService>();

Update the BaseCrudController to take an instance of IDataServiceBase<TEntity> (parameter name of mainDataService) instead of IBaseRepo<TEntity>. 
Remove the BaseRepoInstance property and add protected readonly MainDataService property, updated from the constructor parameter. 
Update all methods to be async, change the return type to be Task<T> instead of T, add the Async suffix to the names, replace the calls to 
RepoBaseInstance with the calls on the MainDataService class, await all async calls. Use RemoveAsyncSuffix instead of Replace("Async", string.Empty).

Update the CarsController to take an instance of ICarDataService instead of ICarRepo and IMakeDataService instead of IMakeRepo. 
Don't assign IMakeDataService to a class level variable.
Update all methods to be async, change the return type to be Task<T> instead of T, add the Async suffix to the names, 
and await the calls to MainDataService. Replace usages of RepoBaseInstance to use MainDataService instead. Use RemoveAsyncSuffix instead of Replace("Async", string.Empty). 
Only override the GetLookupValues (order by Name) and ByMake endpoints. Remember to set the ViewBag.MakeName property. Keep the BadEndPoint commented out.
Use nameof instead of magic strings.

Update the MakesController to take an instance of IMakeDataService instead of IMakeRepo. Update all methods to be async, change the return type to be Task<T> instead of T, add the Async suffix to the names, and await the calls to MainDataService.
usages of RepoBaseInstance to use MainDataService instead. Use RemoveAsyncSuffix instead of Replace("Async", string.Empty).

Update the MenuViewComponent to take in IMakeDataService instead of IMakeRepo. Remove the Task.Run and replace the call to the repo with the call to the data service.

Update all of the custom taghelpers by updating the actionname assignment to use the Async suffix and RemoveAsyncSuffix.
