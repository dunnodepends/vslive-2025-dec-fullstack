Always use file scoped namespaces. Always combine attributes on a single line when possible. 
The project does not use nullable reference types. 
There is a GlobalUsings.cs file that includes common usings, don't include using statements in new files if they are already in the globalusings.cs file.
I prefer expression bodied members when possible. Single line if statements should still use braces. Use ternary operators when appropriate. 
Use internal over private. All classes and methods are public unless told otherwise. Don't add a constructor unless instructed to do so. 
Use primary constructors when possible and don't declare a class level variable if the parameter from the constructor can be used.
Don't initialize properties unless instructed to do so.

All work is to be done in the Autolot.API project.

In the Controllers folder, add a new folder named Base and add a new public abstract class named BaseCrudController that inherits from ControllerBase. 
Make it generic with TEntity, constrained to BaseEntity, new(). Add the ApiController and Route (api/controller) attributes to the top of the class. 
Accept two parameters in the constructor, IAppLogging (appLogging) and IBaseRepo<TEntity> (baseRepo). 
Assign the parameters to two protected readonly properties named AppLoggingInstance and MainRepoInstance, respectively. 

Add the following public virtial action methods:
HttpGet GetAll - (input:none. return type: ActionResult<List<TEntity>>. Logic: return Ok(MainRepoInstance.GetAllIgnoreQueryFilters.ToList()))
HttpGet("{id}") GetOne -  (input int. return ActionResult<TEntity>. Logic: call MainRepoInstance.Find(id). If Entity is null, return NoContent(). Else return Ok(entity)
HttpPut("{id}") UpdateOne (input int id, TEntity entity. return ActionResult<TEntity>. 
Logic: if id != entity.Id, return BadRequest, if ModelState is not valid, return ValidationProblem(ModelState). 
Else call MainRepoInstance.Update with entity, then return Ok(entity)
HttpPost() AddOne (input TEntity entity. return ActionResult<TEntity>. 
Logic: if ModelState is not valid, return ValidationProblem(ModelState) else call MainRepoInstance.Add with entity, 
then return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetOne),new {id = entity.Id},entity))
HttpDelete("{id}) DeleteOne (input int id. return IActionResult. Logic: If id != entity.Id, return BadRequest. Else call Delete on MainRepoInstance. return Ok(entity)

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file if it does not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using AutoLot.Api.Controllers.Base;

Add a new class CarsController to the controllers folder that inherits from BaseCrudController with TEntity as Car and ICarRepo as BaseRepo<TEntity>.
Don't need the ApiController or Route attributes on this class since they are in the base class.
Add the following method:
HttpGet("bymake/{makeId?}") ByMake (input int? makeId. if makeId.HasValue and is greater than zero, return Ok(cast MainRepoInstance to ICarRepo and call GetAllBy passing in the makeId.Value). 
Else return GetAll())

Add a new class for each entity (CarDriver, Driver, make,and Radio) name <EntityName>sController to the controllers folder that inherit from 
BaseCrudController with TEntity as <entityType> and I<EntityType>Repo as BaseRepo<TEntity>.
Don't need the ApiController or Route attributes on this class since they are in the base class.
