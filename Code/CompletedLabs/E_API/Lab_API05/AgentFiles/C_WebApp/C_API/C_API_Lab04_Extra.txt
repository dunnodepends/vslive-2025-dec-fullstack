Always use file scoped namespaces. Always combine attributes on a single line when possible. 
The project does not use nullable reference types. 
There is a GlobalUsings.cs file that includes common usings, don't include using statements in new files if they are already in the globalusings.cs file.
I prefer expression bodied members when possible. Single line if statements should still use braces. Use ternary operators when appropriate. 
Use internal over private. All classes and methods are public unless told otherwise. Don't add a constructor unless instructed to do so. 
Use primary constructors when possible and don't declare a class level variable if the parameter from the constructor can be used.
Don't initialize properties unless instructed to do so.

All work is to be done in the Autolot.API project.

In the Controllers folder, add a new a new class named ContentNegotiationController that inherits from ControllerBase 
and has the ApiController and Route ("api/[controller]") attributes.
Add the following method:
  [HttpGet]
  [Produces("application/json","application/xml","text/csv")]
  public IActionResult Get(IDriverRepo driverRepo) => Ok(driverRepo.GetAll().ToList());

In program.cs, add the call to AddXmlSerializerFormatters() after the call to AddControllersAsServices().
Update the AddControllers() constructor call to add: config.RespectBrowserAcceptHeader = true.
