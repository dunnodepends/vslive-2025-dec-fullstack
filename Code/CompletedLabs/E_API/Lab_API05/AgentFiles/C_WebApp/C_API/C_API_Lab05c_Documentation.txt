Always use file scoped namespaces. Always combine attributes on a single line when possible. 
The project does not use nullable reference types. 
There is a GlobalUsings.cs file that includes common usings, don't include using statements in new files if they are already in the globalusings.cs file.
I prefer expression bodied members when possible. Single line if statements should still use braces. Use ternary operators when appropriate. 
Use internal over private. All classes and methods are public unless told otherwise. Don't add a constructor unless instructed to do so. 
Use primary constructors when possible and don't declare a class level variable if the parameter from the constructor can be used.
Don't initialize properties unless instructed to do so.

All work is to be done in the Autolot.API project unless otherwise specified.

When adding attributes, keep the ApiVersion attribute at the top, following by the HTTP Verb attribute, then followed by route attributes (if any), then documentation attributes.
Add each attribute on it's own line.

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file if it does not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using System.ComponentModel;

Add the following attribute to all controller action methods (even if deprecated) that do not currently have a Produces attribute:
[Produces("application/json")]

Add the following attributes to all controller action methods (even if deprecated) that do not currently have them:
[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status200OK)]
[ProducesResponseType<ProblemDetails>(StatusCodes.Status400BadRequest, "application/problem+json")]

Add the following attribute to all controller action methods (even if deprecated) that return a 201 Created response:
[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status201Created)]

Add the following attribute to all controller action methods (even if deprecated) that return a 204 No Content response:
[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status204NoContent)]

Add the following attributes to all action methods on all controllers:
[EndpointSummary(summary of the endpoint)]
[EndpointDescription(longer description of the endpoint, followed by an example, followed by the JSON required in the request body (if applicable))]

Add the following attribute to all parameters on all action methods on all controllers (even if deprecated) unless the parameter is an interface:
Description - description of the parameter and if it's required or not (required == not nullable or marked with required attribute)

The following work is to be done in the AutoLot.Models project:
Add /// XML comments to the entity classes (BaseEntity, Car, CarDriver, Driver, Make, Model, Radio) all public properties. Make sure the comments come before any existing attributes.
Include <summary>, <remarks>.
