Always use file scoped namespaces. Always combine attributes on a single line when possible. 
The project does not use nullable reference types. 
There is a GlobalUsings.cs file that includes common usings, don't include using statements in new files if they are already in the globalusings.cs file.
I prefer expression bodied members when possible. Single line if statements should still use braces. Use ternary operators when appropriate. 
Use internal over private. All classes and methods are public unless told otherwise. 
Use primary constructors when possible and don't declare a class level variable if the parameter from the constructor can be used. 

All work is to be done in the AutoLot.Web project.

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file if they do not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using AutoLot.Services.ApiWrapper.Configuration;
global using AutoLot.Services.DataServices.Api;

In Program.cs, comment out the existing service registrations for ICarDataService and IMakeDataService
builder.Services.AddScoped<ICarDataService, CarDalDataService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMakeDataService, MakeDalDataService>();

In Program.cs, add the following:
if (builder.Configuration.GetValue<bool>("UseApi"))
{
  builder.Services.AddScoped<ICarDataService, CarApiDataService>();
  builder.Services.AddScoped<IMakeDataService, MakeApiDataService>();
}
else
{
  builder.Services.AddScoped<ICarDataService, CarDalDataService>();
  builder.Services.AddScoped<IMakeDataService, MakeDalDataService>();
}

Add the call to ConfigureApiServiceWrapper in Program.cs as follows:
builder.Services.ConfigureApiServiceWrapper(builder.Configuration);

In appsettings.Development.json, change the rebuildDataBase node to false.
In appsettings.Development.json, add a node as follows:
"UseApi": true,

In appsettings.Development.json, add a new section named ApiServiceSettings with the following values:
"ApiServiceSettings": {
    "Uri": "https://localhost:5011/",
    "CarBaseUri": "api/cars",
    "MakeBaseUri": "api/makes",
    "MajorVersion": 1,
    "MinorVersion": 0,
    "Status": ""
  }

In appsettings.Staging.json, change the rebuildDataBase node to false.
In appsettings.Staging.json, add a node as follows:
"UseApi": true,

In appsettings.Staging.json, add a new section named ApiServiceSettings with the following values:
"ApiServiceSettings": {
    "Uri": "https://localhost:5011/",
    "CarBaseUri": "api/cars",
    "MakeBaseUri": "api/makes",
    "MajorVersion": 1,
    "MinorVersion": 0,
    "Status": ""
  }
