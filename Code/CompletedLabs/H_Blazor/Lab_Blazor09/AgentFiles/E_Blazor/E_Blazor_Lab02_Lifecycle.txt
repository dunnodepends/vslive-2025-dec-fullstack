Always use file scoped namespaces. Always combine attributes on a single line when possible. The project does not use nullable reference types. 
If there is a GlobalUsings.cs file, don't include using statements in new files if they are already in the globalusings.cs file.
I prefer expression bodied members when possible. Single line if statements should still use braces. Use ternary operators when appropriate. 
Use internal over private. All classes and methods are public unless told otherwise. Don't add a constructor unless instructed to do so. 
Use primary constructors when possible and don't declare a class level variable if the parameter from the constructor can be used.
Don't initialize properties unless instructed to do so. The @code block in razor components should be at the bottom of the file.
All work is to be done in the AutoLot.Blazor project.

Create a new folder named Services in the project, and in that folder create a public class named OutputLog. 
Add a List<String> property named Messages to the OutputLog class. 
Implement a method named LogMessage that accepts a string parameter and adds it to the Messages list.

Add a new file named GlobalUsings.cs in the root of the project, and add the following global using statement to it (clear out any other code).
global using AutoLot.Blazor.Services;


Add the OutputLog service to the dependency injection container in Program.cs with a transient lifetime.

Create new folder named Shared, and in that folder, create a Blazor component named "LifecycleDemo.razor" in the that demonstrates the following lifecycle methods: 
OnInitialized, OnParametersSet, SetParametersAsync, OnAfterRender, ShouldRender, OnAfterRender, and Dispose. 
The component should accept a parameter named "Title" of type string and display it in an <h3> tag. 
The component should accept a parameter named "DemoValue" of type int. 
The component should also inject the OutputLog service and use it to log messages during each lifecycle method.
Each lifecycle method that has a callable base method, log a message to the outputlog service indicating when it has been called just 
before calling the base method and just after calling the base method, and the message should include the method name and "before" or "after", accordingly.
Lifecycle methods without a callable base method should just log a message indicating when they have been called.
Additionally, include a button that, when clicked, updates a local property named "ClickCount" 
and displays the number of times the button has been clicked. 
For the SetParametersAsync code, loop through the parameters and add them to the log.
After the button code, loop through the Messages in the OutputLog service and display them in an unordered list.
Also add a query string parameter named "initialCount" of type int with an initial value of 0.
Ensure that the component properly cleans up any resources in the Dispose method.

Add the following to the _Imports.razor file if they do not already exist:
@using AutoLot.Blazor.Shared

Create a new razor page named Lifecycle.razor in the Pages folder that uses the LifecycleDemo component. 
Make the route "/lifecycle-demo". The <PageTitle> value is "Lifecycle Demo". Include a button that increments a local integer property named "DemoValue" 
and passes that value to the LifecycleDemo component as a parameter.

Add a menu item to the NavMenu.razor component that links to the new Lifecycle page with the text "Lifecycle Demo".
Add a font-awsome icon "fa-solid fa-bolt-lightning" to the menu item. Add the icon before the text. Use "pe-2" class on the icon for spacing.
