Always use file scoped namespaces. Always combine attributes on a single line when possible. The project does not use nullable reference types. 
If there is a GlobalUsings.cs file, don't include using statements in new files if they are already in the globalusings.cs file.
I prefer expression bodied members when possible. Single line if statements should still use braces. Use ternary operators when appropriate. 
Use internal over private. All classes and methods are public unless told otherwise. Don't add a constructor unless instructed to do so. 
Use primary constructors when possible and don't declare a class level variable if the parameter from the constructor can be used.
Don't initialize properties unless instructed to do so. The @code block in razor components should be at the bottom of the file.

All work is to be done in the AutoLot.Blazor project.

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file if it does not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using AutoLot.Blazor.Models.Entities;
global using AutoLot.Blazor.Models.Entities.Base;
global using AutoLot.Blazor.Models.Validation;
global using AutoLot.Blazor.Models.ViewModels;

In the Services folder, create a new folder named Interfaces, and in that folder, create a new folder named Base. In that folder,
create an interface named IDataServiceBase typed to TEntity where TEntity is a class that inherits from BaseEntity.
Add the following methods to the interface:
GetEntityAsync(int id) - returns a Task<TEntity>
GetAllEntitiesAsync() - returns a Task<IEnumerable<TEntity>>
AddEntityAsync(TEntity entity) - returns a Task<TEntity>
UpdateEntityAsync(TEntity entity) - returns a Task<TEntity>
DeleteEntityAsync(TEntity entity) - returns a Task

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file if it does not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using AutoLot.Blazor.Services.Interfaces;
global using AutoLot.Blazor.Services.Interfaces.Base;

In the interfaces folder, create a new interface named ICarDataService that inherits from IDataServiceBase<Car>.
Add the following methods to the ICarDataService interface:
GetByMakeAsync(int makeId) - returns a Task<IEnumerable<Car>>

In the Interfaces folder, create another interface named IMakeDataService that inherits from IDataServiceBase<Make>.

Create a folder named Base in the Services folder, and in that folder, create an abstract class named DataServiceBase.
Add two protected properties:
Makes (List<Make>)
Cars (List<Car)

Add a constructor that initializes the properties with the following data:
  Makes =
  [
    new Make { Id = 1, Name = "VW" },
    new Make { Id = 2, Name = "Ford" },
    new Make { Id = 3, Name = "Saab" },
    new Make { Id = 4, Name = "Yugo" },
    new Make { Id = 5, Name = "BMW" },
    new Make { Id = 6, Name = "Pinto" }
  ];
  Cars =
  [
    new Car { Id = 1, MakeId = 1, Color = "Black", PetName = "Zippy", Price = "$45,000.00",
      MakeNavigation = Makes.First(m => m.Id == 1) },
    new Car { Id = 2, MakeId = 2, Color = "Rust", PetName = "Rusty", Price = "$45,000.00",
      MakeNavigation = Makes.First(m => m.Id == 2) },
    new Car { Id = 3, MakeId = 3, Color = "Black", PetName = "Mel", Price = "$45,000.00",
      MakeNavigation = Makes.First(m => m.Id == 3) },
    new Car { Id = 4, MakeId = 4, Color = "Yellow", PetName = "Clunker", Price = "$45,000.00",
      MakeNavigation = Makes.First(m => m.Id == 4) },
    new Car { Id = 5, MakeId = 5, Color = "Black", PetName = "Bimmer", Price = "$45,000.00",
      MakeNavigation = Makes.First(m => m.Id == 5) },
    new Car { Id = 6, MakeId = 5, Color = "Green", PetName = "Hank", Price = "$45,000.00",
      MakeNavigation = Makes.First(m => m.Id == 5) },
    new Car { Id = 7, MakeId = 5, Color = "Pink", PetName = "Pinky", Price = "$45,000.00",
      MakeNavigation = Makes.First(m => m.Id == 5) },
    new Car { Id = 8, MakeId = 6, Color = "Black", PetName = "Pete", Price = "$45,000.00",
      MakeNavigation = Makes.First(m => m.Id == 6) },
    new Car { Id = 9, MakeId = 4, Color = "Brown", PetName = "Brownie", Price = "$45,000.00",
      MakeNavigation = Makes.First(m => m.Id == 4) },
    new Car { Id = 10, MakeId = 1, Color = "Rust", PetName = "Lemon", IsDrivable = false,
      Price = "$45,000.00", MakeNavigation = Makes.First(m => m.Id == 1) }
];

Add the following global usings to the GlobalUsings.cs file if it does not already exist (sorted alphabetically. Don't remove any existing global using statements).
global using AutoLot.Blazor.Services.Base;

In the services folder, create a class named CarDataService that implements ICarDataService and inherits from DataServiceBase.
Implement all of the methods using the Cars and Makes properties from the DataServiceBase class.

In the services folder, create a class named MakeDataService that implements IMakeDataService and inherits from DataServiceBase.
Implement all of the methods using the Cars and Makes properties from the DataServiceBase class.

Add three JSON files named appsettings.json, appsettings.Development.json , and appsettings.Staging.json to the wwwroot folder of the AutoLot.Blazor project. Update the files to the following:
//appsettings.json
{
  "DealerInfo": {
    "DealerName": "Skimedic's Used Cars",
    "City": "West Chester",
    "State": "Ohio"
  }
}

//appsettings.Development.json
{
  "DealerInfo": {
    "DealerName": "Skimedic's Used Cars Development Site",
    "City": "West Chester",
    "State": "Ohio"
  }
}

//appsettings.Staging.json
{
  "DealerInfo": {
    "DealerName": "Skimedic's Used Cars Staging Site",
    "City": "West Chester",
    "State": "Ohio"
  }
}

Add the following to the AutoLot.Blazor.csproj file:
<ItemGroup>
  <Content Update="wwwroot\appsettings.json">
    <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
  </Content>
  <Content Update="wwwroot\appsettings.*.json">
    <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
  </Content>
</ItemGroup>

Add the following three lines to the Program.cs file just before the call to RunAsync() (don't remove any other calls):
builder.Services.AddScoped<ICarDataService, CarDataService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMakeDataService, MakeDataService>();
builder.Services.Configure<DealerInfo>(builder.Configuration.GetSection(nameof(DealerInfo)));
